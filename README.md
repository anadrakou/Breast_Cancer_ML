# Breast_Cancer_ML

Our focus for this repository is to analyze the breast cancer dataset using machine learning algorithms. This dataset, sourced from Python's scikit-learn package (specifically from sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes), offers valuable information for our analysis. By exploring this important dataset, our primary objective is to learn various machine learning algorithms and identify the most effective one.

In our analysis, we employ several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Classification (SVC). Each of these methods provides unique insights and performance metrics, allowing us to compare and contrast their effectiveness in predicting breast cancer outcomes. Through this comparative approach, we aim to determine which algorithm performs best, thereby enhancing our understanding of machine learning techniques and their applications in medical data analysis.
